![HextaUI Logo](/Banner.png)

We started working on the next major version of the project, which will include significant improvements and new features.

This version will focus on enhancing performance, improving user experience, and adding new functionalities based on user feedback.

We are designing entire design system from scratch, which will allow us to create a more cohesive and flexible design language.

Using HextaUI's primitive components, we will build a new design system that is both powerful and easy to use.
